### Languages

### Structure

There's a folder for each language nested in its own kyu

```ascii
├── javascript/
│   ├── 8kyu/
│   │   ├── kataTitle.js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
```

### Vocabulary

- Kata: is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire
- Kyu: is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform

### Purpose

Practicing katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. It could also help going to interviews more confident and learning a few tricks of your prefered language.
I highly recommend the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) which will help you ace your next technical interview.
